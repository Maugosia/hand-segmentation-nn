# Hand segmentation using neural networks

## Description
This project was compleated as part of an academic course and deals with a problem of hand segmentation. 
The dataset used was: database for hand gesture recognition, available here: https://sun.aei.polsl.pl/~mkawulok/gestures/
Implemented neural architecture was based on article: [1]. It is a fully convolutional architecture based on U-net called "skinny".
